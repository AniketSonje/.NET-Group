To create a full stack application for a Management Information System (MIS) using ReactJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB, you can follow these steps:

First, set up your development environment by installing Node.js and the required dependencies, such as ReactJS and MongoDB.

Next, create a new ReactJS project using the create-react-app command. This will generate the basic structure of your application, including the src directory where you can store your React components and the public directory where you can store your static assets such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

In your React application, create a simple form that allows users to enter data into the system. You can use various React form components, such as input, select, and textarea, to create the form fields.

To connect your React application to a NodeJS server and a MongoDB database, you will need to install the express and mongodb packages. Use the express package to create a simple server that listens for requests from your React application and the mongodb package to connect to your MongoDB database.

In your NodeJS server, create a route that handles POST requests from your React application. This route will be responsible for inserting the data from the form into the MongoDB database.

To display the data stored in the MongoDB database in your React application, you can create a new route in your NodeJS server that retrieves the data and sends it back to the React application. In your React application, you can use this data to populate a table or list view.

Finally, you can add additional features to your application, such as authentication, authorization, and validation, to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify the data in the system.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance..
